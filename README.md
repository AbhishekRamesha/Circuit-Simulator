# Circuit-Simulator
This was created as a part of course project [ECE 464]

The “Circuit Fault Simulator” aims to take the input values and fault node & value for the given circuit bench file provided with both good circuit and bad circuit values of the output and also tell if the fault can be detected at the given fault node.

You need a Bench file where you write a circuit as shown in a example below.

INPUT(a)

INPUT(b)

x = AND(a,b)

OUTPUT(x)
